                    <h2>About</h2>
                    <p>MEGACOMPLEX is a 3D exploration game. Inspired by games like "Yume Nikki", "NaissanceE" and "Elevator: Source", 
                        you're encouraged to enter a towering apartment complex and explore its seemingly endless rooms that are not only bigger on the inside, but can also loop on themselves. 
                        <br><br>
                        I started working on MEGACOMPLEX during a creative slump as a way to channel fleeting ideas into a "hub" project where they'd get stored into an interactable building.
                        As such, the main focus of the game is to explore and take in the varying scenes, letting the player's mind wander into piecing together a story for themselves.
                        <br><br>
                        The game was eventually showcased as a proof of concept demo in 2025's "Indie Game Show" fair in Fuengirola, Spain, which was my exciting first time setting up a stand for my own game!
                        <br><br>
                        While the game is still in development with no set release date, the demo showcased during that event can be played.</p>
