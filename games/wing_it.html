                    <h2>About</h2>
                    <p>Wing It! is a fast paced 3D action game where you must learn to pilot an airplane at risk of crashing into the ocean.
                        It's your objective to land it safely in the nearby island.
                        <br><br>
                        This game was made in 48hs for the GMTK Game Jam 2020. The theme of the game jam was "Out of Control", and the idea originated from a mockup I had made earlier in the year, 
                        depicting a view of the skies from a plane cockpit. 
                        <br>
                        I wanted to evoke the phrase "Out of Control" through a high stakes situation, and I took inspiration from 
                        Four Quarters' "Please, Don't Touch Anything" to design the cockpit found in the game, where you're presented 
                        with many buttons and switches but only a select few actually help you pilot the plane. 
                        The game's manual was inspired by the multi-tasking gameplay of "Papers, Please" by Lucas Pope.
